# Running the Pombola tests

## Running the tests for South Africa using docker compose

  docker compose run app bin/wait-for-deps.sh coverage run -a --source=pombola,pombola_sayit,wordcloud ./manage.py test --settings=pombola.settings.tests_south_africa


## Running tests selectively

Sometimes you want to just try one test method and don't want to recreate the 
test database. You can do this for a generic test, for example, with:

  docker compose run app bin/wait-for-deps.sh ./manage.py test --settings=pombola.settings.tests_south_africa --keepdb pombola/south_africa/tests.py:SAHansardIndexViewTest

Note that there must be a colon separating the module from the
class name.

## Speeding up repeated test runs

You can dramatically speed up the second and subsequent test 
runs by supplying the `--keepdb` option to `test`, like:

	docker compose run --rm app ./manage.py test --keepdb \
		pombola.core.tests.test_models:PositionCurrencyTest.test_from_past_still_current

... because much of the time in running the tests is taken up
with running the database migrations.
